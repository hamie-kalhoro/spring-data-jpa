In this repository i have used some basic concept of spring boot and have used mySQL database to store and retrieve data from it. 
<br>
It includes basic crud operations like: post, delete and put and for adding student you have to do it manually, which can be done using StudentConfig class which is specially made to insert data.
<br>
Furthermore, the data should be name, email and date of birth. No other data is needed whether it is id or age, these will be done automatically.
